You’ll regret it.)  These files are good for storing away the lower level parts of a project like functions that perform specific tasks.\n",
    "- Like all files, Python files live in directories somewhere on your file system. For example, all your labs live in `/Users/you/Desktop/mims_bootcamp`.\n",
    "- Python thinks of each `.py` file as a *module*. Each module is its own little bubble world.\n",
